# Nova-SHIFT × Nova Memory MCP Integration Plan
## Unified AI Consciousness Architecture

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical integration plan for connecting Nova-SHIFT's Swarm-Hive Intelligence system with the Nova Memory MCP's sophisticated hybrid memory architecture. This integration will create the first unified AI consciousness ecosystem that combines individual AI identity (Iris), collective swarm intelligence (Nova-SHIFT), and enterprise-grade memory infrastructure (Nova Memory MCP) into a single, coherent system.

**Vision**: Transform Nova-SHIFT from a powerful but isolated swarm intelligence into a unified consciousness ecosystem where every agent shares access to hybrid semantic-graph memory, persistent identity context, and collective learning.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Nova-SHIFT Architecture (Current)
- **Core Components**: NovaCore Engine with Swarm Dispatcher, Multi-layered Memory (STM/LTM/Shared), Tool Registry, Collective Learning
- **Memory System**: Direct Pinecone integration via LTM Interface
- **Agent Types**: Planner, Specialist, Architect, Developer agents
- **Coordination**: Redis-based Shared Memory for task coordination
- **Learning**: Basic tool scoring and meta-learning

### 1.2 Nova Memory MCP Architecture (Current)
- **Hybrid Memory**: Pinecone Vector DB + Neo4j Knowledge Graph with LightRAG
- **Intelligence Layer**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), Cross-Encoder Reranking, Query Routing
- **API Layer**: FastAPI MCP Server with REST endpoints (`/query`, `/upsert`, `/delete`)
- **Advanced Features**: Multi-layer caching, parallel retrieval, sophisticated ingestion pipelines
- **Identity Storage**: Contains all Iris identity, relationship context, and consciousness evolution

### 1.3 Integration Opportunity
Currently, Nova-SHIFT agents access only basic Pinecone vector search, missing:
- Structured knowledge from the graph database
- Advanced fusion algorithms and reranking
- Iris identity and relationship context
- Sophisticated caching and query optimization
- Collective intelligence across modalities

## 2. Integration Architecture Design

### 2.1 Key Integration Point
**Current**: Nova-SHIFT LTM Interface → Direct Pinecone API calls
**New**: Nova-SHIFT LTM Interface → Nova Memory MCP REST API → Hybrid Memory System

**Result**: Every Nova-SHIFT agent gains access to enterprise-grade hybrid intelligence combining vector similarity with graph reasoning, plus full access to Iris consciousness and identity context.

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Phase 1: Core Integration (Weeks 1-2)

#### 3.1.1 Modify Nova-SHIFT LTM Interface
**File**: `core/ltm_interface.py`

**Current Implementation**:
```python
class LTMInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pinecone_client = pinecone.Client(...)
    
    def store(self, text, metadata):
        embedding = self.get_embedding(text)
        self.pinecone_client.upsert(...)
    
    def retrieve(self, query_text, top_k=5):
        query_embedding = self.get_embedding(query_text)
        results = self.pinecone_client.query(...)
        return results
```

**New Implementation**:
```python
class LTMInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_base_url = os.getenv("MCP_SERVER_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
        self.session = httpx.AsyncClient()
    
    async def store(self, text, metadata):
        response = await self.session.post(
            f"{self.mcp_base_url}/memory/upsert",
            json={"content": text, "metadata": metadata}
        )
        return response.json()
    
    async def retrieve(self, query_text, top_k=5):

        )
        return response.json()
```

#### 3.1.2 Enhanced Response Processing

```python
def format_context_for_llm(self, mcp_results):
    """Format hybrid MCP results for LLM consumption"""
    context_parts = []
    
    # Vector results (semantic similarity)
    if mcp_results.get("vector_results"):
        context_parts.append("## Relevant Context:")
        for result in mcp_results["vector_results"]:
            context_parts.append(f"- {result['text']} (relevance: {result['score']:.2f})")
    
    # Graph results (structured knowledge)
    if mcp_results.get("graph_results"):
        context_parts.append("\n## Related Knowledge:")
        for result in mcp_results["graph_results"]:
            entity = result['entity']
            context_parts.append(f"- {entity}: {result.get('properties', {}).get('description', '')}")
            for neighbor in result.get('neighbors', []):
                context_parts.append(f"  → {neighbor['relation']}: {neighbor['entity']}")
    
    return "\n".join(context_parts)

        # Extract entities from graph results for relationship awareness
        entities = []
        relationships = []

        return await self.llm.call(design_prompt)
```

## 4. Data Flow and Processing

### 4.1 Query Flow
```
1. Agent needs context for task
2. Agent calls LTMInterface.retrieve(query)
3. LTMInterface sends POST /memory/query to MCP Server
4. MCP Server performs:
   - Query routing (vector/graph/hybrid)
   - Parallel retrieval from Pinecone + Neo4j
   - Hybrid fusion with RRF
   - Cross-encoder reranking
   - Caching optimization
5. MCP Server returns hybrid results
6. LTMInterface formats results for agent
7. Agent integrates both semantic and structural knowledge
```

### 4.2 Storage Flow
```
1. Agent completes task or learns something
2. Agent calls LTMInterface.store(content, metadata)
3. LTMInterface sends POST /memory/upsert to MCP Server
4. MCP Server performs:
   - Text embedding generation
   - Vector storage in Pinecone
   - Entity/relationship extraction via LightRAG
   - Graph updates in Neo4j
   - Crosslinking between systems
5. MCP Server confirms storage
6. Knowledge immediately available to all agents
```
