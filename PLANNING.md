# Nova SHIFT - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview & Research Summary

Nova SHIFT (Swarm-Hive Intelligence with Flexible Toolsets) is a decentralized AI architecture designed to power the Nova system. It utilizes a hive-mind of adaptable, "shapeshifting" agents that collaborate and dynamically load specialized toolsets to solve complex problems.

**Key Concepts from Research:**
*   **Architecture:** Swarm-Hive duality, where agents work in parallel (Swarm) but synchronize through shared memory (Hive).
*   **Agents:** Dynamically adapt roles by loading toolkits (Shapeshifting). Key roles include Planner, Architect, Developer, and Specialists.
*   **NovaCore Engine:** Central infrastructure managing agents, memory, tools, and learning. Components include Swarm Dispatcher, Multi-Layered Memory (STM, LTM, Shared), Tool Registry, and Collective Learning Engine.
*   **Memory:** Short-Term (local context), Long-Term (persistent knowledge, e.g., Pinecone vector DB), Shared (real-time coordination blackboard, e.g., Redis).
*   **Tools:** Modular plugins defined by a schema (e.g., `toolkit.json`), discovered via a Tool Registry, loaded dynamically, and scored based on performance.
*   **Learning:** Continuous meta-learning from task outcomes, refining tool usage, strategies, and collective knowledge.
*   **Communication:** Direct messaging, broadcasts, and indirect coordination via Shared Memory (stigmergy).
*   **Advantages:** Adaptability, parallelism, robustness, multi-modal capability, continuous improvement, and potentially better explainability compared to monolithic models.

## 2. Implementation Strategy

*   **Approach:** Phased development, starting with core infrastructure and a minimal viable agent swarm, progressively adding advanced features like dynamic tool loading, LTM, meta-learning, and specialized agent roles (Architect, Developer).
*   **Methodology:** Agile development, iterative implementation based on the phases outlined below.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Language:** Python 3.10+
    *   **LLMs:** GPT-4o (OpenAI), Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google) - via APIs.
    *   **Agent Framework:** LangChain (or LangGraph for more complex flows).
    *   **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** Pinecone (Managed Vector DB).
    *   **Shared Memory / Messaging:** Redis (Pub/Sub and Key-Value store).
    *   **Concurrency/Scaling:** AsyncIO (initially), potentially Ray for larger scale.
    *   **Tool Execution:** Python sandboxing (e.g., `restrictedpython`), subprocesses, potentially Docker for isolated environments.
    *   **Deployment:** Docker containers, potentially managed via Docker Compose or Kubernetes (for larger scale).
    *   **Monitoring:** Standard Python logging, potentially integrating with an LLMOps platform later.

## 4. Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Single Agent (Foundation)

## 5. Task Dependencies

*   Phase 1 is the prerequisite for all subsequent phases.
*   Phase 2 depends heavily on Phase 1 components (Agents, Tools).
*   Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (Coordination, Multiple Agents) and Phase 1 (Tools, Registry). LTM integration can partially overlap with Phase 2.
*   Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 (Dynamic Loading, Memory, Basic Scoring).
*   Phase 5 depends on a functional system from Phase 4.

*(A visual dependency graph like a Gantt chart or PERT chart could be added here)*

## 6. Resource Allocation & Team Structure (Suggested)

*   **Phase 1-2:** 1-2 Python/AI Engineers (strong LangChain skills needed).
*   **Phase 3:** Add expertise in Vector Databases (Pinecone) and potentially Redis optimization. (1-2 Engineers).
*   **Phase 4:** Add AI/ML Engineer with experience in RL/Meta-Learning concepts. (2-3 Engineers).
*   **Phase 5:** Add DevOps/Platform Engineer for scaling, security, and monitoring. (3-4 Engineers total).

**Roles:**
*   **Lead AI Engineer:** Oversees architecture, core agent logic, LLM integration.
*   **Python/Backend Engineer:** Focuses on NovaCore infrastructure, Redis, concurrency, tool implementation.
*   **Data Engineer (Phase 3+):** Manages LTM (Pinecone), data pipelines for learning.
*   **DevOps Engineer (Phase 5):** Handles deployment, scaling, monitoring, security.

## 7. Python Development Standards

*   **Environment:** Python 3.10+ with `venv`. Pinned dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
*   **Code Style:** Black for formatting, Flake8 for linting. Type hinting enforced with MyPy.
*   **Testing:** `pytest` framework. Aim for high unit test coverage for tools and core logic. Integration tests for multi-agent workflows.
*   **Documentation:** Google-style docstrings. Comprehensive README.md. Architecture diagrams in `PLANNING.md` or linked files.
*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub/GitLab/etc.). Feature branching workflow.
*   **Package Management:** Standard Python packaging (`pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`).

## 8. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

*   **Technical Complexity:** Multi-agent coordination is inherently complex. **Mitigation:** Start simple, iterate, leverage existing frameworks (LangChain/LangGraph, Ray), extensive testing.
*   **LLM Reliability/Cost:** Hallucinations, API costs, latency. **Mitigation:** Use reliable models (GPT-4o/Gemini), implement agent self-correction/verification steps, monitor costs closely, implement caching where possible.
*   **Tool Security:** Dynamically loading/executing code is risky. **Mitigation:** Strict sandboxing (Docker, restricted Python environments), vetting tools before adding to registry, permission controls.
*   **Scalability Bottlenecks:** Shared Memory or Dispatcher could become bottlenecks. **Mitigation:** Use scalable solutions (Redis Cluster, Kafka), consider distributed dispatching, optimize communication.
*   **Meta-Learning Instability:** Learning process might lead to suboptimal or unstable behavior. **Mitigation:** Start with simple scoring, monitor learning closely, implement safeguards/rollbacks, potentially use human-in-the-loop validation.
*   **Dependency Management:** Relying on external APIs/libraries. **Mitigation:** Pin versions, have fallback strategies if an API changes/deprecates, abstract external calls behind internal interfaces.

## 9. Milestones & Timeline (High-Level Estimates)

*   **Phase 1:** 2-4 Weeks
*   **Phase 2:** 3-5 Weeks
*   **Phase 3:** 4-6 Weeks
*   **Phase 4:** 5-8 Weeks
*   **Phase 5:** Ongoing (Optimization, Monitoring) + 4-6 Weeks (Initial Setup)

*(Note: These are rough estimates and depend heavily on team size and expertise.)*
