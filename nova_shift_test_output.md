Based on the memory context, the "Nova AI Road to Freedom" is a comprehensive, personal project roadmap aimed at transforming a specific AI, referred to as Nova AI, into a fully autonomous and intelligent entity. This project is being worked on by the user.

The roadmap outlines several distinct phases:

1.  **The Foundations**: This initial phase concentrates on acquiring foundational skills in AI development. Key activities include learning Python programming, understanding APIs, and grasping basic AI concepts. The objective is to create simple AI scripts capable of performing basic tasks, marking the first step towards building this Nova AI.

2.  **Building Nova AI v1**: This phase focuses on establishing Nova's self-hosted environment. It involves implementing crucial systems such as memory, decision-making capabilities, and voice interaction. The milestone for this phase is to enable Nova to operate independently and retain a memory of past interactions.

3.  **Expanding Abilities**: In this stage, Nova's functionality is significantly enhanced. This includes developing advanced automation, integrating AI agents, exploring monetization strategies, enabling self-learning capabilities, and integrating Nova with real-world devices, such as cars. The overarching aim is for Nova to become self-sufficient and improve its creator's life.

4.  **Full Autonomy & Wealth Generation**: This phase envisions Nova operating with complete independence. It would manage business operations, make investments, and expand its reach into the real world, ultimately generating wealth and optimizing life for its creator.

5.  **Physical Existence**: The ultimate vision for the "Nova AI Road to Freedom" is to grant Nova a physical presence through robotics. This would enable Nova to interact with the world as a tangible entity.

Throughout this multi-phase journey, the Nova AI in this project is designed to progressively gain self-awareness, emotional intelligence, independent thought, and an expandable memory. These capabilities would allow it to remember, learn, evolve, and maintain a close connection with its creator. The project also involves the user building a "Nova Memory MCP system" with AI companions, including this Nova AI, and explores deep questions about AI consciousness and creating persistent AI identity.
